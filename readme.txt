--IMPORTANT-- Contributor & Developer Agreement: If a contributor or developer creates either original[2] assets, code, or localization for 'UKBETA' and that work is published,[1] 'UKBETA' retains the right to use that material even if said contributor or developer no longer wishes to be or have said work affiliated with 'UKBETA' under opensource development principles. Once said assets, code, or localization is published,[1] the contributor or developer cannot invoke Hearts of Iron 4 Modding Community guidelines as a basis for removal of work. The above stipulations do not apply to code or assets that have been made for other Hearts of Iron 4 Modifications, other forms of media, or work that derives from copyrighted material as defined by either United States or European Union law that is included in 'UKBETA.'[3] The contributor or developer may ask to withdraw work if said work isn't published[1] yet. To reiterate: 'UKBETA' retains the right to use all original contributor and developer work made for 'UKBETA.' Even if said contributor and developer wishes to be no longer affiliated with UKBETA and asks for removal of assets, code, or localization made by them. Such requests are considered meritless under this agreement. If you want to discuss particulars of this agreement, contact slight Of Handio

Forking and Using 'UKBETA' in Other Projects

If 'UKBETA' is forked or its assets, code, or localization are used in other projects, the following conditions must be met to ensure respect for the original contributions and maintain the spirit of open collaboration:

    Attribution: Any project that incorporates work from 'UKBETA', whether in whole or in part, must provide clear and explicit credit to the 'UKBETA' project as the source of the material. This attribution should be visible and accessible in any of the project materials where 'UKBETA' content is used, including but not limited to project documentation, the project's website, or within the application or game itself.

    Link to Original: Alongside the credit, a link must be provided back to the original 'UKBETA' repository on GitHub (or any other official platform 'UKBETA' may reside on in the future). This link facilitates access to the original work and encourages further exploration and contribution to 'UKBETA'.

    No Misrepresentation: While using 'UKBETA' assets, code, or localization, it is important not to misrepresent the origin or ownership of the materials. The use of 'UKBETA' materials should not imply endorsement or partnership with 'UKBETA' unless such a relationship has been formally established.
