Welcome to the Battle for Britian mod for Hearts of Iron 4!

This mod is a complete overhaul of the game, transforming it into a UK focused civil war game. This civil war won't be rooted in any sort of history/reality.

To give an Idea of what I'm aiming for here these are a few of the things I've got planned:

Shaun the sheep, Bob mortimer, Ronnie Pickering and Demoman all to be country leaders

Custom focus tree to raise lizzy from the dead)

Barry 53, from sunderland

Aims before public release (0.5v):

- New goverment types
- Custom Laws/Goveners
- Custom Decisions
- Atleast 20 different countries, including atleast 5 majors (probably will end up being more)
- All Majors and some minors with custom focus trees
- Fully configured custom UK map.

Eventual Additions:
- Custom Tech tree
- More Custom Focus trees
- Lakes Added to the map
- The rest of ireland + islands around the UK (Jersey, Guernsey etc)
